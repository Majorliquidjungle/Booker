“A scrupulous writer”, observed Orwell, “in every sentence that he writes will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?” Scrupulous writers will also notice that their copy is edited only lightly and is likely to be used. It may even be read.

art but who still want to write realistic hand-to-hand. They are: GET TOUGH, by William Fairbairn, who taught practical combat to his colleagues in the Shanghai (!) Municipal Police, and later to British commandos and US Rangers during WWII. KILL OR GET KILLED, by Rex Applegate, reputedly a friend and collaborator of Fairbairn. This is the military version of the Get Tough stuff. Some of their techniques are a little outdated for serious martial artists, but it’s worth pointing out that Applegate’s style is exceedingly practical, and can be effective even when used by inexperienced fighters. The updated 1976 edition of Kill or Get Killed was published by the US Marine Corps as Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication 12-80.

back to the person he’d been five seconds before? Back. By turning into a lump of red flesh, by having all the features ripped from her face, hadn’t she been trying to tell him something?—to go back upstream, to swim against the current, back into the womb, into her womb, and remember. Yes, that was it! That was what she’d been trying to say. Remember… that sound, the one he and Hashi had heard in the padded room. It wasn’t the sound of raindrops outside the window, Hashi; but you were right, it was distorted, heard at a distance, through layers of obstruction, and it would give whoever heard it peace. It was the sound of a human heart beating; that’s what we heard in the hospital: the sound of a heart. It was the beating heart of that woman doomed to be shot one day by the baby she threw away. That woman who was my mother. That woman who had me and left me, in the summer, in a box; that woman who left me for dead, but was trying to teach me something by dying herself, becoming a raw, rubbery thing. In that one instant she was teaching me everything I’d need to know to go on living after I’d been left alone. I can see now: nothing else mattered for her; she stood up and came to me, no one else; and it was for me alone that she spoke. She was a wonderful mother…

As they entered the final straightaway, Kiku swung wide, and in a few strides he passed the two men ahead of him. Even after he crossed the finish line, he went on running, the tape fluttering around his chest. His teammates let out a cheer and surged toward him, but Kiku still wanted to run. His body felt light, as if he could have jumped the gray prison wall without even using a pole. Propelled forward by an energy that seemed to course up through his legs, he ran straight to the wall and hurled the red baton as hard as he could, as if draining every last bit of strength in his body. The baton rose in a high arc, caught the sunlight for a moment, then tumbled out of sight.

look in the mirror and I don’t recognize the face staring back at me. It’s like my body’s split down the middle and the two halves aren’t always doing the same thing. You know what it is? It’s this fly; you see, in every ten thousand flies, there’s one that has a face like a human being, and somehow I swallowed one of them. I figured it out: these human-looking flies are people who did such godawful things in a previous life that they have to come back as flies. That’s what’s buzzing around inside my head trying to tell me what to do…

He didn’t want to kill her; in fact, there was nothing he wanted less to do… yet that, he feared, was exactly why he had to do it. And fear was what seemed to control Hashi, not a run-of-the-mill fear of death or starvation, but a more basic, paralyzing one: the fear of time. It was something he knew instinctively, remembered in his cells, the way a baby does. Hashi had spent thirteen hours in that coin locker, thirteen summer hours. Thirteen hours of dogs barking, loudspeakers announcing the name of the station, bicycle bells, vending machines, a blind man tapping his cane, trash blowing about, music from a radio

Alternatively, CFCs might be introduced by sending rockets with payloads of compressed CFCs on collision courses with Mars.[37] When the rockets crashed into the surface they would release their payloads into the atmosphere. A steady barrage of these "CFC rockets" would need to be sustained for a little over a decade while Mars changed chemically and became warmer.

Use of orbital mirrors Mirrors made of thin aluminized PET film could be placed in orbit around Mars to increase the total insolation it receives.[20] This would direct the sunlight onto the surface and could increase Mars's surface temperature directly. The 125 km radius mirror could be positioned as a statite, using its effectiveness as a solar sail to orbit in a stationary position relative to Mars, near the poles, to sublimate the CO 2 ice sheet and contribute to the warming greenhouse effect.

Terminology The expression "astral projection" came to be used in two different ways. For the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn[30] and some Theosophists, it retained the classical and medieval philosophers' meaning of journeying to other worlds, heavens, hells, the astrological spheres and other landscapes in the body of light; but outside these circles the term was increasingly applied to non-physical travel around the physical world.
